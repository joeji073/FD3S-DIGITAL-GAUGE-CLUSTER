# FD3S-DIGITAL-GAUGE-CLUSTER

Overview:
I originally started this digital gauge cluster project for my FD3S RX7 since I needed a way of keeping an eye on engine vitals, but didn't want to add gauges pods all over the dashboard. The project actually started as a single external LCD project but eventually turned into a full custom gauge cluster that tried to keep the OEM design language. 

While I'm happy where the gauge cluster currently is, there are still a lot of things that need to be finished. I taught myself how to code by watching Youtube videos and searching the internet so I don't have enough skill and knowledge to finish this. I don't want this project to be wasted and I think with the help of more knowledgeable people, this gauge cluster could become something really nice. 

With that said, I don't want to see this project commercialized or sold for profit. I would like to keep this gauge cluster project free for anyone who would like to make one of their own.

Notes:
1. For those that are expecting to download the files, buy the parts and put it together in a day, it's not even close. Almost all of the parts I used are obsolete and I don't want to spend the time to find alternate solutions.
2. Keep in mind that I've never taken a class on coding/PCB design. What you're going to see is ugly but it works as a proof of concept. I did the work of proving that yes, it's physically possible to fit five LCD screens behind the bezel. The code is literally consists of basic functions that a 10 year old could probably re-write better in a few hours. I uploaded the files not as a way for people to replicate the same thing I have but instead to spark new ideas, whether it's with different hardware or software. I've looked into the LVGL library and it looks like a better option than the FTDI EVE based displays.
3. I'm not going to provide the gauge background jpeg's since they aren't hard to replicate and I'd like to see original designs.
