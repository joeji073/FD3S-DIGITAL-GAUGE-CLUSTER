# FD3S-DIGITAL-GAUGE-CLUSTER

Overview:
I originally started this digital gauge cluster project for my FD3S RX7 since I needed a way of keeping an eye on engine vitals, but didn't want to add gauges pods all over the dashboard. The project actually started as a single external LCD project but eventually turned into a full custom gauge cluster that tried to keep the OEM design language. 

While I'm happy where the gauge cluster currently is, there are still a lot of things that need to be finished. I taught myself how to code by watching Youtube videos and searching the internet so I don't have enough skill and knowledge to finish this. I don't want this project to be wasted and I think with the help of more knowledgeable people, this gauge cluster could become something really nice. 

With that said, I don't want to see this project commercialized or sold for profit. I would like to keep this gauge cluster project free for anyone who would like to make one of their own.

Notes:
1. For those that are expecting to download the files, buy the parts and put it together in a day, it's not even close. Almost all of the parts I used are obsolete and I don't want to spend the time to find alternate solutions.
2. Keep in mind that I've never taken a class on coding/PCB design. What you're going to see is ugly but it works as a proof of concept.
3. I'm not going to provide the gauge background jpeg's since they aren't hard to replicate and I'd like to see original designs.
